= release_notes

This is a plugin for release notes.

<b>It's Not Ready Yet!!! No guarantees - this will probably not work, and may mess things up. Only tested in Redmine 1.2.1 so far.</b>

= install

* Download or clone the repository
* Copy to vendor/plugins/redmine_release_notes
* rake db:migrate_plugins RAILS_ENV="production" (assuming you don't want a different environment. If you're not sure, you probably don't)
* rake release_notes:create_custom_fields - this creates the custom fields that this plugin requires to work.
