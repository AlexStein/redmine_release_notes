# Release notes for Redmine

This is a plugin which will allow you to store, manage, and generate lists
of release notes for Redmine projects.

There is more information on the [wiki](https://github.com/hdgarrood/redmine_release_notes/wiki).

## Compatibility

This has been tested with versions of Redmine from 1.2 to 1.4, and
ought to work with all of them. However, it will not currently work
with version 2.0 (rails 3). If there's enough interest, I'll do the
work.
