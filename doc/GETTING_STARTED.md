# redmine release notes

Do any of the following apply?

* You have to produce release notes for your projects
* You end up going through the roadmap issue by issue, writing release notes
  for each
* You wish it was easier to check whether all the release notes have been done
  for a particular version

If so, then this plugin may be just what you need.

## features

* Create/read/update/delete release notes per issue. This is done from the
  issue's "show" page (ie, what you go to after entering its ID in the search
  box).
* Show a list of versions, together with how close the release notes are to
  being done. Done from "Release notes" tab in project menu.
* Generate release notes for a particular version.
* Define templates for generated release notes.
* Localizable - currently there are English, German, Russian, and French
  translations.
